## About ## 

This is another Intro to C assignment. It's supposed to add 2 numbers together from the command line, but I keep getting an EXC\_BAD\_ACCESS error once the program gets to Input[i]. Read the comments in the code for more info.

This code is released under the "Don't Plagiarize" license. In other words, you can do whatever with the code except for plagiarize. By plagiarism, I follow the [GWU code of Academic Integrity](http://www.gwu.edu/~ntegrity/code.html#definition) by defining it as "intentionally representing the words, ideas, or sequence of ideas of another as one's own in any academic exercise; failure to attribute any of the following: quotations, paraphrases, or borrowed information." (not that you'd want to plagiarize this one anyway though, considering how bad code it is)
